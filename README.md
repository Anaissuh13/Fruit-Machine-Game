# Fruit-Machine_Game
 Fruit Machine - A Java Project. 
Publishing an assignment made in the first year in Java. This was an individual assignment, built on eclipse IDE.
The objective of this assignment was to get creative and use methods. This is a user-friendly and visually appealing project.
We also had to connect the game with documents to store the user's game history.
A brief description of how to play the game:
 - Upon starting the user will be able to view the menu, which will have four options (New Game, Rules, Points, Exit)
 - We were supposed to develop our own rules and credit analogies for the game (getting creative).
 - The Points option will show the user how many points they have, every user upon starting has a certain amount of points (play to find out!)
 - If the user chooses the New Game option, they will be further prompted to select the mode. The normal mode with normal rules has three options (Easy, Medium, Hard) but there is another
   mode which has its twist to the rules. (Play to Find Out)
